This is a project of EMPLOYEE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.
topics covered in making this project is:
1.swing
2.awt
3.stream
4.oops

The main problem faced while making this project came up when we need to delete a record from
the file because technically we cant delete any record from the file.
#####-------####
The solution of the problem was taking a temp file and copying all the data from the main file except 
the data to deleted then deleting the original final and rename the temp file as original file.

 /----------HOW TO USE-----------/
 simply compile all the java files .
 run testproject.java file
 and thats all !!!
